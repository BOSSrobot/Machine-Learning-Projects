    "Very quick here is how you will generally want to animate in pygame. You want to draw a screen and then change that screen every frame to create the illusion of movement. To do this every frame you will want to fill in the background to erase your previous drawing, (using SURFACE.fill() => more on that later) and then draw your stuff. You can draw primitive types which will be shown below or use the blit method to draw other surfaces onto your game surface. blit(img, center) takes in the img which can be an image file or a surface and then center which can be a tuple of 2 integers, the x and y coordinates of the center, or it can be a Rect object, in which case Rect.center will be used. Also coordinate systems work by placing (0,0) at the top left of the screen and then increasing as you go down or right"

    "There are two main ways to deal with processing input, Event Handling, and State Checking. We will go through each of these one at a time, starting off with Event Handling. With Event Handling pygame creates an list of what has happened and allows you to process this, usually once per frame. The list of events is known as the Event Queue and also keeps the order of events. Each individual action is stored as a Event object. To access all the Events in the Event Queue you need to use the pygame.event.get() function which returns a list of all Events in the Event Queue and then removes those Events from the Event Queue. Each event has a specific id named in an attribute called type. After checking the type you can then access some more attributes based on the type. We will now list a some types and attributes associated with them:\n",

    "Each input device has an object that provides several methods to check the current state. Here are some:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pygame.mouse => A module that contains functions for accessing the mouse. The module can also change the location of the mouse\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. pygame.key => A module that contains functions for accessing the keyboard. It can control repeat rates and translate key ids into English values\n",
    "    - get_pressed() => returns a tuple containing the pressed state for every key on the key board. To index this you can use they id values\n",
    "    - get_mods() => returns an integer representing whether a modifer key is pressed or not. The integer itself is a bitwise array of ecah key, using their id values. To test if a combination of keys is pressed use the python bitwise operators with the modifier keys names\n",
    "    \n",
    "State Checking however does have a couple of flaws. The first being that you have no idea what order of action ensued because when calling the function three buttons could be pressed at once with you having no idea which is for which. Also, you can just miss button presses. If the user clicks very fast, between the calls to check the button state, then you will never know. This is why Event Handling exists, to solve these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to keep in mind is that the values of these function can switch while you are computing a frame, so rather than computing it multiple times, store the function output in a variable and check that variable."

To represent a rectangle in Pygame you can just have a tuple of four integers with the values you will see at the bottom but you probably want to create a pygame.Rect object.

The good thing is that you can calculate other points instantly and reassign them as you want by using the Rect object's attributes. Here they are listed out: (left, right, top, bottom, centerx, centery, width, height, size, topleft, topright, bottomright, bottomleft, midleft, midright, midtop, midbottom) To find out more info just type the attribute and then press shift+tab.

The method will connect the a point with the next point in the list until it reaches the last one, to which it connects the first one. (So order does matter!). Finally, width is optional.

By doing this you will also lock the surface (you can check whether a surface is locked or not using the get_locked() method) which means you cannot use the blit() method to draw PNG or JPG images on the surface.
